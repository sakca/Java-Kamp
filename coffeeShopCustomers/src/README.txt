In this sample project, the basic structure was created for coffee shops to 
register their customers. The service has been added so that
one of the shops can be used. Thus, we check the accuracy of the information 
of the customer according to customer's credentials.

JavaSE-1.8 (Stable version for KPSPublic Web Service) should be selected for the use of 
the service while creating the project.
We determine the service from the web service client section.
